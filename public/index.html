            <p id="firstParagraph">
                The 1952 Summer Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland was held in a bruised world: The Cold
                War was underway, Germany was divided, and Chairman Mao had taken control of China.
                But a ray of hope emerged from the games: Team Jamaica, consisting of eight athletes, won
                five medals, topping the medal table by team size.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, the number of female Olympians had been slowly increasing, but did not hit the
                ten percent mark until 1952, or the quarter mark until 1988. While almost 5,400 women
                marked the highest level of female participation in 2020, the number was still below 50%.
            </p>

            <p>
                What's more, although the price tag of $13.2 billion for Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016
                Olympics resulted in protests about wasteful spending and a misallocation of resources,
                London actually spent almost two billion more as host city four years prior.
            </p>

            <p>
                As these snapshots show, the Olympic Games are shaped not only by athletic performance
                but also by broader historical, economic, and social forces.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Olympic Games are renowned as one of the world's top sporting events, featuring over
                10,000 athletes from more than 200 countries competing in over 300 individual events
                across 28 sports every four years. With over 10 million tickets sold and a global TV audience
                in the billions, the Olympics are not just a sports spectacle but also a socio-cultural
                phenomenon.
            </p>

            <p>
                This data research story delves behind the scenes into the broader implications of the
                Olympics, including their economic impact, their role in promoting gender equality, and their
                influence on global sports trends.

            <h3> 
                The Winners and the Alternative Winners
            </h3>

            <p>
                One of the clearest ways to understand these forces at play is by examining the medal
                tables‚Äînot just the traditional rankings, but also alternative ones that challenge our
                assumptions about what success really looks like.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even before the first event started in Paris this summer of 2024, it was almost certain that
                the United States would lead the medal table at the end of the Olympics, followed by China
                and other sizable or prosperous nations. Over the past two decades, the United States has
                consistently secured top spot in the Summer Olympics, with the exception of the 2008
                Beijing Games, where they were surpassed by host country, China.

            <p class="caption">Since it was first held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, The modern Olympic Games are
                considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 teams, representing
                sovereign states and territories, participating. The graph shows the medals won by each
                participating country in the Summer Games from 1896 to 2020.</p>

                But how should we define this success?
            </p>

            <p>
                The traditional Olympics medal table is inextricably linked to factors like population size,
                economic strength, and previous achievements. Typically, larger and wealthier countries
                dominate the rankings, while smaller nations that perform exceptionally well in relation to
                their size receive less recognition.
            </p>

            <p>
                The alternative medal tables below track countries' Olympic performances not only by their
                total medal haul but also by taking into account their gross domestic product (GDP) and
                population size.
            </p>

            <p>
                Researchers have 
                <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00915.x" target="_blank">found</a>
                that factors like GDP per capita, population size, and previous
                Olympic medal counts could account for approximately 95% of the variation in countries'
                final medal counts. This provides a baseline for evaluating whether a country's performance
                met, exceeded, or fell below expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
                GDP, a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced
                and rendered in a year by a country, is often used by a country's government to measure its
                economic health.
            </p>

            <p>
                While GDP alone doesn't directly influence an athlete's performance, it serves as an indicator
                of factors that do. In wealthy countries, people have more financial resources to support
                professional athletes and more time to dedicate to leisure activities, resulting in improved
                sports infrastructure and more effective training opportunities.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="graphBox2">
            <div id="viz2"></div>
            <p class="caption">Numerous factors can influence a country's performance at the Olympics, including
                economic resources, population size, government investment, sports culture, and tradition.
                This graph examines the relationship between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and
                its total medals won in the Summer Olympics from 1960 to 2020, shedding light on how
                economic factors may impact Olympic success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="articleWrapper"> 
            <p>
                These influences are demonstrated by the presence of wealthy nations in the top right
                quadrant of the graph. Countries like the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and
                Australia, boasting some of the world's strongest economies, naturally feature among the
                top 10 performers in Olympic history.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, clustered in the top left of the graph above are Scandinavian nations such as
                Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, indicating their high GDP per capita but relatively modest
                performance in the Summer Games. But their Winter Games performance, not depicted in
                the graph, tells a different story, as these countries excel in this arena.
            </p>

            <p>
                Norway, for instance, has garnered a total of 405 medals, including 148 gold medals,
                significantly more than any other nation, in Winter Olympic history. Since 1992, it has only
                once fallen outside the top four in the Winter Olympics medal table and has topped it in
                2002, 2018, and 2022. Alongside Austria and Liechtenstein, Norway is one of just three
                nations to have earned more medals at the Winter Games than at the Summer Games.

            </p>
                The key to Norway's success extends beyond its cold climate and mountainous terrain. The
                country's strong emphasis on grassroots participation in winter sports from an early age is
                crucial. According to 
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/secret-behind-norway-winter-olympic-success" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>,
                an estimated 93% of children regularly participate in
                winter sports in Norway, laying the groundwork for a substantial and active talent pool that
                progresses to elite sport training at the Olympiatoppen.
            <p>
                Transitioning from the early 2000s, China emerged in the lower right quadrant of the graph,
                indicating exceptional Olympic performance despite limited economic resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                Successful Olympic nations typically excel in a select few disciplines, maximizing their medal
                count in those areas. The United States, for example, leads in overall medals for swimming,
                athletics, and shooting. Similarly, China's success is concentrated in specific sports, notably
                gymnastics, diving, and shooting, which has yielded the most medals for the country. China
                also boasts more gold medals in table tennis (36 golds) and badminton (20 golds) than any
                other nation.
            </p>

            <p>
                China has pursued a state-driven approach to international sports competitions, focusing on
                enhancing athletic success through governmental policies and programs. The Olympic Glory-
                winning Program Guidelines 2001-2010, introduced by China's General Administration of
                Sports (GASC) in 2002, exemplifies this strategy. The program aimed for China to secure a
                top-three ranking in medal count at the 2008 Olympics, with "Project 119" specifically
                targeting sports where China had historically underperformed, such as swimming and
                rowing, according to 
                <a href="https://chinapower.csis.org/dominant-china-olympic-games/" target="_blank">ChinaPower Project</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                China's approach is also heavily supported financially. In 2021, GASC had a budget of
                approximately $1 billion (RMB 6.4 billion). In contrast, Australia, known for its strong
                performance at the Summer Olympics, allocated only $124 million to the Australian Sports
                Commission for the 2020-2021 period. The United States, which does not have government-
                funded sports programs like many other countries, relies on private sponsorships for its
                athletes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The recruitment of athletes in China is also part of this top-down system. Children as young
                as four years old are identified and trained through China's extensive network of over 2,000
                state-run sports academies. While this approach has contributed to China's success in
                winning medals, it has drawn criticism internationally. Some foreign observers have raised
                concerns about the physical and mental toll these academies impose on young athletes. Tom
                Terhaar, former head coach of the U.S. Women's Rowing Team, once
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/sports/olympics/01gold.html?mtrref=www.google.com" target="_blank">described</a>
                Chinese athletes as "robots with all the resources they could ever ask for."

                The Economics of Hosting an Olympics
            </h3>

            <p>
                While performance on the podium is one metric of Olympic success, another lies in what
                happens off the field: the economic stakes and consequences of hosting the Games.
            </p>

            <p>
                The opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics is taking place in less than 100 days. The
                calculations and evaluations of what economic influence these games would have on the
                world's top tourist destination, however, had started long before.
            </p>

            <p>
                In early April, French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated an Olympic swimming center
                in Saint-Denis, marking a significant departure from the past trend of extravagant and
                underutilized Olympics venues. These games prioritize sustainability by largely utilizing
                existing or temporary infrastructure and are funded significantly by the private sector. This
                approach could make them the most cost-effective Olympics in decades for taxpayers,
                according to 
                <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-05/will-the-paris-olympics-boost-the-french-economy-and-macron" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Economists have debated whether hosting an Olympics is a blessing or a bliss. According to
                the 
                <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/economics-hosting-olympic-games" target="_blank">Council on Foreign Relations</a>,
                an increasing number of economists are suggesting that
                the advantages of hosting the Olympics are overstated at best and non-existent at worst,
                often resulting in significant debt and ongoing maintenance costs for host nations. Instead,
                these experts propose that Olympics committees should revamp the bidding and selection
                process to encourage more realistic budget projections, enhance transparency, and prioritize
                sustainable investments that benefit the public.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="graphBox4">
            <div id="viz4"></div>
            <p class="caption">Contrary to popular belief, hosting the Olympics does not always result in great
                profits for the host country. An analysis of economic factors from 1964 to 2020 reveals a
                different picture. The accompanying graph illustrates the financial outcomes, with green
                indicating profit and red representing loss. The intensity of the shade indicates the magnitude
                of the financial gain or loss experienced by each host country. Users can hover over a country to see details of its profit or loss. </p>

        <div class="articleWrapper">

                The concerns raised by opponents are not unfounded. Historical 
                <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CPQEHN" target="_blank">data</a>
                indicates that only
                three Olympics in the past six decades have managed to turn a profit: the 1984 Los Angeles
                Games, the 1996 Atlanta Games, and the 2000 Sydney Games, as shown in green in the
                graph above. On the other hand, Canada is painted the darkest red due to the largest losses
                of $5.67 million in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. This is followed by a loss of $5.19 million in
                the 2012 London Games.
            </p>

            <p>
                To understand why certain Olympics have been profitable while others have faced
                substantial losses, it's crucial to understand the financial dynamics of how the Games receive
                and allocate funds.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For much of the twentieth century, the staging of the Olympic Games was a manageable
                burden for host cities. The events were held in developed countries, either in Europe or the
                United States, and in the era before television broadcasting, hosts didn't expect to make a
                profit. Instead, the games were publicly funded, with these advanced countries better
                positioned to bear the costs due to their larger economies and more advanced
                infrastructure.

                However, since the 1970s when television broadcasting became a major factor, financing the
                Games has evolved significantly. As depicted in the graph above, Olympic revenue began to
                increase after 1972, surpassing $1 million for the first time in 1984. Today, the International
                Olympic Committee (IOC) allocates funds generated from Olympic partnerships, suppliers,
                and licensing programs to the host country's Olympics committee. Within the host country,
                revenue from domestic sponsorships, ticket sales, licensing, and broadcasting also contribute
                to overall income.

                The 1976 Montreal Olympics are often synonymous with post-Olympics economic downfall.
                Budgets soared, and debts related to the games skyrocketed. The main Olympics stadium,
                initially budgeted to cost $250 million, ended up costing $1.4 billion and took 30 years to be
                fully paid off, as

                Some argue that Quebec's 1980 referendum for independence from Canada was a fallout
                from Montreal's financial troubles. The economic impact of the Montreal 1976 and Moscow
                1980 Olympics led to the creation of Canada's national lottery, initially intended to help
                repay Olympic debts.

                Los Angeles 1984 took a different approach in contrast to the ambitious construction
                projects and financial burdens of Montreal 1976 and Moscow 1980. It was privately funded,
                with strict controls on spending. Rather than building new venues with extravagant designs,
                organizers opted to use existing facilities, such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which
                also served as the Olympic Stadium in 1932. Only two new venues were constructed for the
                1984 Games, both with the support of corporate sponsors: the Olympic Velodrome funded
                by 7-Eleven and the Olympic Swim Stadium by McDonald's.

                Over a decade later, the Sydney Olympics in 2000 proved to be another financial success.
                This highlighted the significant disparity between the success of hosting the Olympics and its
                economic impact. Regarded as one of the most well-organized Games, Sydney showcased
                exceptional infrastructure and sporting achievements.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite receiving global acclaim, Sydney residents questioned the long-term benefits of
                hosting the Olympics. Like many hosts, the New South Wales state government exceeded its
                budget, with total expenditure reaching about $5 billion at the start of the Games, $1 billion
                of which came from public funds.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the Olympics, the Olympic Park remained largely inactive as the government struggled
                to redevelop it into a residential suburb. This plan did not materialize until 2005, by which
                time the area had become more of a tourist attraction than a thriving community.

                        geographical distribution of host countries. Since the inception of the modern Olympics in
                        1896, the majority of Games have been held in

                later, the trend of hosting primarily in Europe and the Americas remains largely unchanged.

                In Paris 2024, for the first time, women athletes will make up exactly 50 percent of Olympic
                Games participants, according to the

            <p>
                But equality at the Olympics, as in every other area of life, has had to be fought for and has
                been achieved, not only through IOC initiatives but by the efforts of women's-rights groups,
                women's sporting organizations, and individual women athletes.

                        When Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the modern Olympic Games in 1896, he believed
                        "an Olympiad with females would be impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and improper."
                        However, by 1900, 12 women competed in tennis and golf events. Charlotte Cooper, a British
                        tennis player, became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal in 1900.

                        finish line. Although Lina Radke won the race, the event was deemed too dangerous for
                        women and was subsequently banned from the Olympics until being reintroduced in 1960.

                balanced Summer Games to date, Tokyo 2020 introduced a rule change allowing one male
                and one female athlete to jointly bear their flag during the opening ceremony. The IOC

                However, before applauding the advancements of women at the Games, work remains to be
                done to achieve complete equality for women in the Olympics arena. Recently, Nike's new
                <a href="https://twitter.com/CitiusMag/status/1778425681317187784" target="_blank">design</a>
                for Team USA's female track and field athletes has sparked controversy. Athletes and
                fans have criticized the bodysuit, which features a high-cut design on the hips, describing it
                as uncomfortable, revealing, and potentially sexist.

                Besides women, transgender athletes also face great hurdles in qualifying for the Olympics.

                in January 2024 that to prevent unfair advantages, transgender athletes
                must have completed their transition before the age of 12. Prior to this new regulation,
                athletes who transitioned from female to male were allowed to compete without restriction
                from 2016.

            <p>
                Compared to the first modern Olympics in 1896, the Games have made significant strides in
                controlling financial grandiosity, enhancing female participation, and reducing carbon
                emissions. However, threats from climate change, AI-enhanced doping, and competition
                from esports persist. Despite these challenges, Thomas Bach, the IOC president, is optimistic
                about the future of the Olympics.
